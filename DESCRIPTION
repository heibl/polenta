Description: PASTA (Mirarab, Nguyen, and Warnow 2014) is a highly accurate and scalable algorithm for multiple sequence alignment. GUIDANCE  (Penn, Privman, Landan, Grauer, and Pupko 2010) is a well-performing method for the assessment of alignment uncertainty. Both methods are available as stand-alone programs, but, unfortunately, cannot be combined. This package provides a reimplementation of PASTA and GUIDANCE to combine their power to accurately align large numbers of sequences.
